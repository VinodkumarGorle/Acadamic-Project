# Hate speech detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning 
## Abstract
> Hate speech is currently of broad and current interest in the domain of social media.
The anonymity and flexibility afforded by the Internet have made it easy for users to
communicate aggressively. And as the amount of online hate speech is increasing, methods
that automatically detect hate speech are very much required. Moreover, these problems have
also been attracting Natural Language Processing.

> One of the critical tasks of automatic detection of hate speech is differentiating it from
the other context of offensive languages. The existing works obtained less accuracy due to
using these algorithms. In the proposed system Linear SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms are
used. All the models were performed using sci-kit learn on machine learning using Python.

> In this project, an NLP (Natural Language Processing) technique is used for identifying
and extracting keywords that convey hate speech. Finally, based on a machine learning
technique called Logistic regression and Naïve Bayes algorithms, which are popular for
probability calculations, are used to train the computer to classify hate speech using the data
extracted from any kind of data you wish to utilize for training

## Objective
#### The main objective of the work is :
* Hate Speech detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms.
* Classify tweets into two classes based on sentiment analysis.

## Introduction of Hate speech
#### Hate Speech :
* Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race religion, ethnic origin, national origin, gender, disability, or sexual orientation.
* In the face of the popularization of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tik Tok, communication between people has become faster and easier. In these communication mechanisms, people can express their feelings, criticism, opinions, achievements, etc.
* The big problem with this relies on the fact that the offense is presented to individuals or groups and this can be potentially harmful to them.
#### Natural Language Processing:
** NLP is a field in machine learning with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language.Its goal is to build systems that can make sense of text and automatically perform tasks like translation, spell check, or topic classification
###### NLP in Real Life		Example
* Information Retrieval   	Google finds relevant and similar results
* Machine Translation   	Google Translate translates language from one language to another.
* Text Simplification   	Simplifies the meaning of sentences. 
* Sentiment Analysis    	Hater News gives us the sentiment of the user.
* Text Summarization	    It gives a summary of sentences.
* Spam Filter	    	Gmail filters spam emails separately.
* Auto-Predict	  	Google Search predicts user search results.
##### Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK): 
** NLTK is a popular open-source package in Python. Rather than building all tools from scratch, NLTK provides all common NLP Tasks.
