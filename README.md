# Hate speech detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning 
### Abstract

> Hate speech is currently of broad and current interest in the domain of social media.
The anonymity and flexibility afforded by the Internet have made it easy for users to
communicate aggressively. And as the amount of online hate speech is increasing, methods
that automatically detect hate speech are very much required. Moreover, these problems have
also been attracting Natural Language Processing.

> One of the critical tasks of automatic detection of hate speech is differentiating it from
the other context of offensive languages. The existing works obtained less accuracy due to
using these algorithms. In the proposed system Linear SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms are
used. All the models were performed using sci-kit learn on machine learning using Python.

> In this project, an NLP (Natural Language Processing) technique is used for identifying
and extracting keywords that convey hate speech. Finally, based on a machine learning
technique called Logistic regression and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms, which are popular for
probability calculations, are used to train the computer to classify hate speech using the data
extracted from any kind of data you wish to utilize for training

### Objective
#### The main objective of the work is :
* Hate Speech detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning algorithms.
* Classify tweets into two classes based on sentiment analysis.


## Introduction of Hate speech
#### Hate Speech :
* Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race religion, ethnic origin, national origin, gender, disability, or sexual orientation.
* In the face of the popularization of social media such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tik Tok, communication between people has become faster and easier. In these communication mechanisms, people can express their feelings, criticism, opinions, achievements, etc.
* The big problem with this relies on the fact that the offense is presented to individuals or groups and this can be potentially harmful to them.


#### Natural Language Processing:
- NLP is a field in machine learning with the ability of a computer to understand, analyze, manipulate, and potentially generate human language.Its goal is to build systems that can make sense of text and automatically perform tasks like translation, spell check, or topic classification
###### NLP in Real Life		Example
* Information Retrieval :   	Google¬†finds relevant and similar results
* Machine Translation :  	Google Translate¬†translates language from one language to another.
* Text Simplification  : 	Simplifies the meaning of sentences. 
* Sentiment Analysis   : 	Hater News¬†gives us the sentiment of the user.
* Text Summarization	:    It gives a summary of sentences.
* Spam Filter	 :   	Gmail filters spam emails separately.
* Auto-Predict	:  	Google Search predicts user search results.
##### Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK): 
- NLTK is a popular open-source package in Python. Rather than building all tools from scratch, NLTK provides all common NLP Tasks.


## Exicting System
* One of the critical tasks of automatic detection of hate speech is differentiating it from the other context of offensive language. The existing hate speech recognition systems used the Naive Bayes classifier.

* As the existing model did not use NLP techniques such as Semantic analysis, sentiment analysis, and unigram feature, they could not achieve the desired accuracy. 

## Proposed System 
* The proposed system aims to increase the accuracy of hate speech prediction using Natural Language Processing and Logistic Regression techniques.

## Software Requirements:
* Operating system 	   	: Windows XP/7/10
* Software		:  Python 3.6 or high version
* IDE                              	:  PyCharm.
* Framework                            :   Flask  
## Hardware Requirements:
* RAM			:  8 GB
* Hard disk		:  More than 500 GB	
* Processor		:  Intel 5th generation or high.

## Dataset Description
* Text file is used for detecting Hate Speech
* Size of the dataset:-7.53 MB
* The dataset contains 40740 entries.
* All 40740 entries are used.
* The Dataset contains 10 fields,
* Training Data: 80%
* Testing Data:20%
* Dataset is Collected from the reference of the Kaggle website
* https://www.kaggle.com/code/tarushi89/hate-speech-data-analysis/data

## Algorithms
### Logistic Regression :
* Logistic Regression was used in the early twentieth century. It was then used in many social science applications. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable (target) is categorical.
For example,
* To predict whether an email is a spam (1) or not (0)
* Whether the tumor is malignant (1) or not (0)
* G(x)=  1/((1+ùëí^(‚àíùëß)))
  here 
   * Z is the Value of the response variable
   * ∆ü  is the Intercept
   * x1, x2‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Are the regression coefficients
