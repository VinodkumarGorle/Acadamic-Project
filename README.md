# Hate speech detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
Hate speech is currently of broad and current interest in the domain of social media.
The anonymity and flexibility afforded by the Internet have made it easy for users to
communicate aggressively. And as the amount of online hate speech is increasing, methods
that automatically detect hate speech are very much required. Moreover, these problems have
also been attracting Natural Language Processing.
One of the critical tasks of automatic detection of hate speech is differentiating it from
the other context of offensive languages. The existing works obtained less accuracy due to
using these algorithms. In the proposed system Linear SVM and Naive Bayes algorithms are
used. All the models were performed using sci-kit learn on machine learning using Python.
In this project, an NLP (Natural Language Processing) technique is used for identifying
and extracting keywords that convey hate speech. Finally, based on a machine learning
technique called Logistic regression and Na√Øve Bayes algorithms, which are popular for
probability calculations, are used to train the computer to classify hate speech using the data
extracted from any kind of data you wish to utilize for training
